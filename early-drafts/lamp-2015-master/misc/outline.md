By the way, you may remember that a prime number is an integer greater than 1
which only has itself and 1 as factors. Since this is puzzle prime, you may want
to start by taking out the letters in prime position above... If you can solve
this puzzle, your team will get a bonus which will put you into prime position
to win the first ever Lamar Mathematical Puzzlehunt!
Good luck!


Opening Challenge: Get a Clue!
------------------------------

### Description

Mr. Boddy has been murdered (again?), and you may be familiar with the
six Suspects who were in his mansion at the time of death: Mrs. White,
Colonol Mustard, Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Ms. Peacock, and Mr. Green.
There were six possible Weapons, and nine total Rooms.

We've interviewed all six Suspects, and their testimony has been written
on posters displayed in an area near the Galloway Business Building.
By putting the facts together, you should be able to determine which
**suspect** had which **weapon** in which **room**, as well as
**who is guilty of murder**.

But be careful! The five innocent suspects will *always tell the truth*, but
you *can't trust the guilty party*. The murderer will say anything to deflect
suspicion from them.

Report the guilty Suspect, Weapon, and Room to the game organizer, and your team
will receive a packet of puzzles including further instructions, and 100
points. Your team will only be allowed to guess three times, and you must finish
within 30 minutes to earn any points. After 30 minutes, all teams can pick up
their puzzle packets.

Once you have the puzzle packet, head to your team headquarters and start
solving!


### Testimony

##### Mrs. White

*Oh dear, you think I'm a suspect?*
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

* I was in the Kitchen.
* The Dining Room was empty.
* The Knife was in the Lounge.

##### Colonol Mustard

*Me, a murderer? Nonsense!*
Here's how I remember it.

* I was in the Billiard Room.
* Plum had the Wrench.
* Scarlet was in the Lounge.

##### Miss Scarlet

*No way I would hurt poor dear Mr. Boddy!*
Let me help you find out the real culprit.

* The murder happened in the Conservatory.
* The Lead Pipe was in the Ballroom.
* White had the Candlestick.

##### Professor Plum

*Balderdash! I couldn't have done it!*
I'll be happy to educate you on why.

* I was in the Hall.
* Scarlet had the Wrench.
* Mustard was in the Conservatory.

##### Ms. Peacock

*Why, I couldn't harm a fly!*
Someone else must have done him in.

* I was in the Ballroom.
* Green had the Revolver.
* The Study was empty.

##### Mr. Green

*I can't believe you suspect me.*
I didn't like him, but that doesn't make me a killer!

* I was in the Library.
* Mustard had the Rope.
* The Hall was empty.


### Solution

* White, Candlestick, Kitchen
* Mustard, Rope, Billiard Room
* Scarlet, Knife, Lounge
* Plum, Wrench, Conservatory (guilty)
* Peacock, Lead Pipe, Ballroom
* Green, Revolver, Library
* *Empty: Dining Room, Study, Hall*


Puzzle 1: A Base-ic Puzzle
--------------------------

### Description

Our usual numbering system is called "base-10" since, for example,
$8324 = 8\times 10^3 + 3\times 10^2 + 2\times 10 + 4$.

Computers sometimes use what's known as a "base-16" system, also known
as hexadecimal. To get numerals bigger than $9$, the letters $A=10$, $B=11$,
etc. are used. For example, $8D3_{16} = 8\times 16^2 + 13\times 16 + 3 = 2259$
and $FACE_{16} = 15\times 16^3 + 10\times 16^2 + 12\times 16 + 14 = 64206$.

We've coverted a clue to the location of a Fun Fact into the base-10 numbers
below. Here's something to get you started: $46248\Rightarrow ZOO_{?}$.

Puzzle 2: Balancing Act
-----------------------

### Description

The labels on these scales can be rearranged to spell out a clue
to the location of a Fun Fact. These rules will tell you how to
rearrange the letters:

* It's a balance scale, so the total weight on each side is exactly the same.
* Weights $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are the same for each picture.
* The weight $?$ is always a unique weight between $1$ and $40$ from scale
  to scale.
* Ordering the weights alphabetically also orders the weights from least to
  most heavy.

### Scales

Note A=1, B=3, C=9, D=27.

Puzzle 3: A Dicey Sitution
--------------------------

### Description

Suppose during each round of a certain game, three players
(named Red, Green, and Blue) take turns moving their color die from its
current cell to an adjacent cell by rolling it over. Here's an example
of a legal move:

The below pairs of images show the beginning and end of a game where in
each set exactly one player has made an illegal move. Rearrange the groups of
letters associated with each cheating player to reveal a clue to the location
of a Fun Fact.

Mathematical Challenge: Secret of Nim
-------------------------------------

### Description (Earned after 1 puzzle solve)

Here's a classic mathematical problem from the field of *Game Theory*.

Let $Nim(A,B,C,D)$ be a two-player game with the following rules:

* Four piles of stones are placed on the table.
* $A,B,C,D$ are non-negative integers which describe how many stones are
  in each pile.
* Each player takes turns removing any positive number of stones, as long as
  all the stones removed are in the same pile.
* The player whose turn begins with no stones left loses the game.

Here's an example of a playthrough of $Nim(9,7,2,0)$:

* Player 1 takes $4$ stones from pile $B$, leaving $(9,3,2,0)$ stones.
* Player 2 takes $8$ stones from pile $A$, leaving $(1,3,2,0)$ stones.
* Player 1 takes $1$ stone from pile $A$, leaving $(0,3,2,0)$ stones.
* Player 2 takes $1$ stone from pile $B$, leaving $(0,2,2,0)$ stones.
* Player 1 takes $2$ stones from pile $C$, leaving $(0,2,0,0)$ stones.
* Player 2 takes $2$ stones from pile $B$, leaving $(0,0,0,0)$ stones.
* Player 1 has lost because there are no stones left to take.

Your puzzle is to figure out a condition on the numbers $A,B,C,D$ so that
the second player has a **winning strategy**: a strategy which ensures that
she will win the game *no matter what the opponent does*. You'll also need to
describe how that strategy works. The strategy could be described in terms
of the opponent's moves, for example, "the second player always takes at
least as many stones as the first player each turn". (Hint: that ain't it,
sorry!)

There are a number of possible answers, but we've chosen two interesting
solutions which describe infinitely many combinations of $A,B,C,D$.
If you find the first of those two solutions, your team will earn
**100 points**, but if you can find the second solution (which is tougher!)
your team will earn an additional 100 points for a total of **200 points**.

To solve this challenge, go to Staff Headquarters and describe your condition
and winning strategy to the game organizer. There is no limit (within reason)
for how many guesses your team can make on this challenge until the end of the
competition. Also, feel free to ask the game organizer any questions you have
which might clarify the challenge or the rules of $Nim$.

### Hint 1 (Earned after 2 puzzle solves)

The first solution we're looking for could be described as a "copycat"
strategy, but it's up you to figure out what condition $A,B,C,D$ must fit
in order to use it.

For example, $Nim(5,12,10,3)$ fits the tougher solution, but Player 2 can't
use the copycat strategy to win the game.

### Hint 2 (Earned after 3 puzzle solves)

Hey, we know it seems off-topic, but here's a couple of definitions for you:

* Puzzle 1 uses various base systems for numbers. Another useful base
  system is the binary or base-2 system. For example,
  $10110_2=1\times 2^4+0\times 2^3+1\times 2^2+1\times 2+0=22$.

* A computer using binary might perform what's called the "exclusive or"
  operation $\oplus$, which switches the $0$s and $1$s in the
  first number for each digit which is a $1$ in the second number. For example:

    *  $10011_2 \oplus 01010_2 = 11001_2$
    *  $1001_2 \oplus 1101_2 = 0100_2$
    *  $011011_2 \oplus 100011_2 = 111000_2$

So what? Well, for some reason, game theorists call $\oplus$ the
"nim sum operator"...

### Hint 3 (Earned after 4 puzzle solves)

Here's a **big** hint to help you wrap up this mathematical
challenge. *The hard solution involves $A\oplus B\oplus C\oplus D$.*

You're almost done! We hope you've had fun playing, and good luck on this
last puzzle. :-)
